    Complete the following steps. Once you are done create a new repository in github, deploy this file to github and send a link to the project in Google Classroom
    1. add an H1 tag with your name (hint try using emmet by typing H1 and hit tab)
        
    2. Add a photo of yourself below your h1 heading
    
    3. Below your photo add an h2 tag with a caption that describes the photo. The size won't' make sense for a caption but we will edit this later with CSS
    
    4. Below your link create an unordered list with multiple list items in it. The list items should include a timeline about you, facts about you, or you can have two lists that include both.
    
    5. Add a link at the bottom of your page that links to your linkedIn account.
    
    6. If you want to go above and beyond and extra flourishes to you page, that would be encouraged and celebrated!
    
    7. Deploy this page to your github and submit the link to your repository. Make sure that everything works on Liver Server before you deploy your page!

jobs.html
education.html

<a href="./jobs.html">Jobs</a>
<a href="./education.html">Education</a>

h2 tags the are the name of those places
h2 tags with job title and academic achievements

lists of job responsibilities and areas of study

    We have the basic Elements of our About Page, but currently the look pretty ugly. Take what you learned in class today to style both projects. Create a style.css file and link it to your index.html files.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Please do your best to make each page unique to you, but also as professional as possible.

Some suggested edits for would be...

About Page:

-Give your H1 element a size, font-weight, and font that you feel is appropriate.
-Size your image so that it keeps its aspect ratio but fits in the page.
- Give your list items an appropriate font, font-size and font-weight.
- Style your link
-give your body, or other elements a background color.
-If you can make it look professional, you can incorporate borders into your project.
